  <p>
    Effectively managing the variations of products in an e-commerce store is
    one of the most important parts of its design. Inundating the customer with
    too many options at once for any single product would be a bad idea.
    <br />
    Amazon's option selection feature hides product variants that are out of
    stock dynamically. As you select options, the choices available are filtered
    out. The button or dropdown for a specific variant is disabled or a visual
    flag is shown to indicate that the option cannot be ordered.
    <br />
    The objective of this article is to precipitate the simple logic and filters
    behind such a system. I will show how my first solution works. Then we can
    analyze and improve the code.

  <h3>Setting product attributes</h3>
  <!-- prettier-ignore -->
  <pre>
        <code>
          const product = {

            variants: [
                [
                    type: 1,
                    packSize: 100,
                    material: 'gold'
                ],
                [
                    type: 2,
                    packSize: 100,
                    material: 'gold'
                ]
            ]
        }
        </code>
    </pre>
  <p>
    Products in my application come in a few varieties with respect to the
    complexity of the variations offered. They can have no options, just a
    **Type**, a **Type and Pack**, or a **Type, Pack, and Material**. The
    specific variety is stored in the 'whichType' variable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's set this up. Here is some state for our Dropdown component (which - to
    put in context - is being fed product variants on a product details page):
  </p>
  <pre>
        <code>
          const [whichType, setWhichType] = useState();
          const [hasPackOptions, setHasPackOptions] = useState();
          const [hasTypeOptions, setHasTypeOptions] = useState();
          const [hasMaterialOptions, setHasMaterialOptions] = useState();
      
          useEffect(() => {
              let hasPackOptions = false;
              let hasTypeOptions = false;
              let hasMaterialOptions = false;
              product.variants.forEach((variant, index) => {
                  hasTypeOptions = hasTypeOptions || variant._type != null;
                  hasPackOptions = hasPackOptions || variant.pack != null;
                  hasMaterialOptions = hasMaterialOptions || variant.material != null;
              });
              if (hasTypeOptions) setWhichType("justType");
              if (hasPackOptions) setWhichType("typeAndPack");
              if (hasMaterialOptions) setWhichType("typePackMaterial");
              setHasPackOptions(hasPackOptions);
              setHasTypeOptions(hasTypeOptions);
              setHasMaterialOptions(hasMaterialOptions);
          }, [product.variants]);
        </code>
    </pre>
  <p>
    We are using the the react-select package, which requires an _options_ array
    per dropdown with the following shape
  </p>
  <pre>
        <code>
          const options = [
          { value: 'chocolate', label: 'Chocolate' },
          { value: 'strawberry', label: 'Strawberry' },
          { value: 'vanilla', label: 'Vanilla' },
        ];
        </code>
    </pre>
  <p>
    For extra feedback, I customized the styling with an additional value which
    will be translated into a red or green dot to indicate whether the product
    is in stock or not. For now let us leave this out.
  </p>

<section class="article-section">
  <h3>Getting the currently selected variant at the end</h3>
  <p>
    Our react-select setup consists of a (controlled in the React sense)
    dropdown for each _hasPackOptions_, _hasTypeOptions_, and
    _hasMaterialOptions_. A product can have 0 or more of these. When all of the
    dropdowns are selected, then we show the user the current variant. (There is
    also logic for currently selected image - which may become narrowed down to
    1 option prior to the specific current variant becoming known. We will leave
    detail out.)
    <br />
    Here is the state for this:
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code>
    // Options redetermined on each re-render
    // Keep these vars in mind for later
    let packOptions = {};
    let typeOptions = {};
    let materialOptions = {};

    // Options filtered via currently set type, material, and packSize
    const [type, setType] = useState();
    const [material, setMaterial] = useState();
    const [packSize, setPackSize] = useState();

    // Current variant
    const [currVariant, setCurrVariant] = useState();
  </code>
</pre>
  <p>
    Here is the useEffect triggered by type, packSize, and material (triggered
    in turn by selection of the dropdowns). Basically, we have a updateFilters
    object. The correct value is stepped into via the whichType key we set
    earlier. Each filter function is applied to the product variants array. It
    will only yield a true result when enough options have been selected.
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      useEffect(() => {
        const updateFilters = {
            justType: ({ _type }) => {
                return _type && type && _type === type.value;
            },
            typeAndPack: ({ _type, pack }) => {
                return (
                    _type &&
                    type &&
                    _type === type.value &&
                    pack &&
                    packSize &&
                    pack === packSize.value
                );
            },
            typePackMaterial: ({ _type, pack, material: _material }) => {
                return (
                    _type &&
                    type &&
                    _type === type.value &&
                    pack &&
                    packSize &&
                    pack === packSize.value &&
                    _material &&
                    material &&
                    _material === material.value
                );
            },
        };

        if (whichType) {
            setCurrVariant(() => {
                return product.variants.filter(updateFilters[whichType])[0]
            });
        }
    }, [
        type,
        material,
        packSize,
        whichType,
        product.variants,
        setCurrVariant,
    ]);

  <h3>Showing the correct filtered variants on each select onChange event</h3>
  <p>
    This all works as planned but we still need to present the user with right
    options for the level of selection they are in. If they have selected just a
    product type, and the product has a whichType equal to 'typePackMaterial',
    then we need to filter out products whose type is not equal to the currently
    selected type. These will run on each re-render. For example, if a product
    is of type 'typeAndPack', and the user has just selected a type, we collect
    all variants that are of that type. Minor details here are too only
    'collect' the 'packsize value' and only show one example of any single
    'packsize value'.
  </p>
  <pre>
  <code>
    if (hasTypeOptions && !hasPackOptions) {
      typeOptions = product.variants
          .map((p) => p.\_type)
          .filter((v, i, a) => a.indexOf(v) === i)
          .map((type) => ({
              label: type,
              value: type
          }));
  }
  if (hasTypeOptions && !hasMaterialOptions) {
      typeOptions = product.variants
          .map((p) => p.\_type)
          .filter((v, i, a) => a.indexOf(v) === i)
          .map((type) => ({
              label: type,
              value: type
          }));
      packOptions = product.variants
          .filter((p) => type && p.\_type === type.value)
          .map((p) => p.pack)
          .filter((v, i, a) => a.indexOf(v) === i)
          .map((packsize) => ({
              label: packsize,
              value: packsize
          }));
  }
  if (hasMaterialOptions) {
      typeOptions = product.variants
          .map((p) => p.\_type)
          .filter((v, i, a) => a.indexOf(v) === i)
          .map((type) => ({
              label: type,
              value: type
          }));
      materialOptions = product.variants
          .filter((p) => type && p.\_type === type.value)
          .map((p) => p.material)
          .filter((v, i, a) => a.indexOf(v) === i)
          .map((material) => ({
              label: material,
              value: material
          }));
      packOptions = product.variants
          .filter(
              (p) =>
                  type &&
                  p.\_type === type.value &&
                  material &&
          p.material === material.value
          )
          .map((p) => p.pack)
          .filter((v, i, a) => a.indexOf(v) === i)
          .map((pack) => ({
              label: pack,
              value: pack

  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p>
    An easy-to-grab improvement on this code would be to memoize the material
    and pack options whenever they are determined for a type selection. This
    would reduce the number of calculations.
    <br />
    In the database, these product variations are simply held as a list.
    Although the data is normalized in the proper SQL sense, I believe the code
    smell from all these boolean comparisons originates from non-ideal storage
    in the database. A better data structure for the products I am presenting
    would be lists within lists or an acyclic, disconnected graph. At least with
    respect to parsing the data for display in the dropdowns. In other areas of
    this e-commerce platform - even other areas within this same page - such a
    non-linear data structure would have the opposite effect on efficiency.
    Practically speaking, for a product with a whichType equal to
    'typePackMaterial' we could have something like:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      const product = {
        varants: [
            {
                type: 1,
                materials: [
                    {
                        material: 'gold',
                        packsizes: [1, 10, 100]
                    }
                    {
                        material: 'silver',
                        packsizes: [1, 10, 100]
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                type: 2,
                materials: [
                    {
                        material: 'gold',
                        packsizes: [1, 10, 100]
                    }
                    {
                        material: 'silver',
                        packsizes: [1, 10, 100]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    ]
    }
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    I herein am led to believe that the only meaningful improvement on the code
    can come from mimicking the directional flow of the hierarchical structure
    above in the methods used to parse the list. The simplest way would be to
    turn the product variants list into nested lists. Here I am thinking of a
    useReducer hook which takes in our list as its initial state. The hook would
    re-organize the state into the easy to parse hierarchy and simply traverse
    the tree via the the dispatch function it issues us. We can link the
    dispatchers to the onChange property of the dropdowns. Thank you for
    reading.
